First you'll need to pull the repo onto vs code

Next you'll need to create a virtual environment(venv) and download all the packages mentions in the requirements.txt file onto it in order to make the program function

Lastly once you've downloaded all the packages you need to type in the terminal (with venv activated) python website_builder.py
